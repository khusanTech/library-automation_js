Feature: User Groups Filtering

    As an admin, I should be able to filter the user groups on the "Users" page.


    #* AC: Admins should be able to filter the user groups on the "Users" page
    #* AC: There should be three options under the user groups dropdown menu: ALL, Librarian and Student


    #TODO: Verify that the User Group dropdown is displayed on the Users page
    #TODO: Verify that "ALL" option is selected by default on the Users page
    #TODO: Verify that the User Group dropdown menu has "ALL", "Librarian" and "Students" those three options
    #TODO: Verify that after the admin filters by student, then the all group columns should have the value of "Students"
